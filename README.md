# 📊 Salary Band Matrix Analysis — Portfolio Capstone

## Overview
This project explores salary distribution across job categories, cities, seniority levels, remote-friendliness, and industries using a real-world job market dataset. The goal was to build a clean, scalable analytics matrix that reveals compensation trends and supports career decision-making.

## Tools Used
- Excel (Pivot Tables, formula logic, data cleaning)
- Power BI (dashboard-ready layout in progress)
- SQL & Python (planned for enrichment and automation)

## Key Achievements
- Created 10 pivot-based matrices including:
  - Salary Band vs Job Category
  - Salary Band vs City
  - Salary Band vs Seniority
  - Salary Band vs Remote-Friendly
  - Salary Band vs Industry
- Cleaned and standardized salary bands into Low, Mid, and High tiers
- Handled missing values (`-1`, blanks) with logic-driven replacements
- Delivered actionable insights on pay dynamics across sectors and roles

## Sample Insight
> “Remote roles show a higher proportion of mid-to-high salaries compared to onsite roles, suggesting that flexibility may correlate with compensation.”

## Next Steps
- Build interactive Power BI dashboard
- Enrich dataset with manual industry tagging and external sources
- Publish SQL/Python scripts for automation and reproducibility
